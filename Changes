This file documents the revision history for Perl extension Test-DBIx-Class.

0.07  26 August 2009
    - Create framework for 'pluggable' storage traits and migrated all the
      SQLite specific stuff to a SQLite trait.  This change will allow us
      to add traits to test replication and other types of database setups.
    - Documentation and test improvements to reflect the above.
0.06  25 August 2009
    - Documentation additions related to overridding configuration via %ENV
    - Fixes to broken POD
    - Allows the option 'force_drop_table' to be set at configuration time
    - More completely documented ::SchemaManager options
    - Some additional (undocumented) features added to the exported subroutine
      generators.  
	
0.05  24 August 2009 @ 11::55::00 UTC
    - New Feature: Perform configuration file substitutions, similar to the way
      Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader works.  Added tests and docs.

0.04  24 August 2009
    - Fixed some minor documentation typos and improved error reporting when a
      schema fails to deploy (we now properly report the actual error instead of
      silently dying).
    - New Feature: You can now set $ENV{TEST_DBIC_CONFIG_SUFFIX} to add more
      searchable paths when we are gathering and merging all the existing 
      configuration files.  See documentation for more.

0.03  23 August 2009
    - Reverted to a version of the Makefile that actually has all the 
      dependencies listed correctly.
