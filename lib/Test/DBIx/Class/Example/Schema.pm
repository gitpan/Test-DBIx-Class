=head1 NAME

Test::DBIx::Class::Example::Schema - A basic schema you can use for testing

=head2 SYNOPSIS

	my $schema = Test::DBIx::Class::Example::Schema->connect($dsn);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Schema has two purposes.  First, we need one in order to properly test
this distribution.  Secondly, we'd like to offer a useful and simple schema
that component authors can use to test their code.  This way you don't have
to keep rolling your own example database and we can concentrate effort on
making one that is solid.
